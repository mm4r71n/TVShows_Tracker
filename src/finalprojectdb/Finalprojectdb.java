/**
 * On this project I could not complete what i set out to do.
 * As people will realize when the program is run there are 3 buttons
 * initially there were supposed to be 3 more buttons which would allow the user
 * to decide either to see all the information on the table, the second button 
 * would allow to see only one type of information and the last one would show the other type of information 
 * this information being shows or animes. I try my best to make it work completely 
 * but i could not find the way on time for the final project. This class was fun and 
 * even though my last program which was supposed to be a creation of my own did not meet 
 * my own expectations i learned a lot and this is just the beggining for me.
